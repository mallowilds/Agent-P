/*Patch Notes

Changes (1.1, 3/30/24):

//Nair feels a bit strong right now, I don't want to nerf it too heavily but here are some minor changes just to bring it slightly more in line.
//Theoretically it shouldnt be that crazy - But if it proves to be too strong going forward i'm willing to change it more.
- NAir late hit damage 5 -> 4
- NAir startup 3 -> 4

//Fair was really overtuned and i kinda overlooked it while playtesting. These changes should make it more situational in its usecase than other aerials like nair or bair, but still have it be a strong option.
- FAir startup 5 -> 8
- FAir endlag 12 -> 14 (18 -> 21)
- FAir landing lag 6 -> 7 (9 -> 11)
- FAir multihit lerp amount slightly reduced (.5 -> .35)

//I added a funny little thing to DTilt, but removed a funny little thing from DTilt.
+ Dtilt now has a back hitbox on his tail that sends at a 70 degree angle with much less knockback. Still combos really well into Up Air, so i'll be keeping an eye on how it hashes out in real games.
- Removed the 1.1x hitstun multiplier from DTilt, a relic of when i initially put it in but forgot to take out. (It didn't do much tbf, but it shouldn't have been there in the first place.)


~ FSpecial now has sound and visuals for when stopped by enemy hitboxes
~ FSpecial now enforces a minimum speed of 2 while grounded
~ FSpecial swing hurtboxes fixed
~ Added runes B, N (and rearranged 1-cost runes)
~ Fixed AI not attacking ever
~ Adjusted the "Courageous" alt to look a bit more, uh ... Courage-y.



v2.0


// Fixes to consistency issues.
+ DTilt's main hit now has higher priority
+ FStrong multihits now force flinch
+ FStrong multihit angle 40 -> 30
+ FStrong multihit lerp 0.4 -> 0.5

// FSpecial felt really committal and zoner-ish before, so it's being taken in a new direction.
- FSpecial no longer places opponents into hitstun
- FSpecial follow-up hit removed
+ FSpecial is now entirely actionable while grappling to opponents
+ When grappling to opponents, Perry will try to remain grounded
~ Wall/article grapple gravity and acceleration reduced (0.3 -> 0.2, 0.8 -> 0.6)
+ FSpecial is now dramatically faster, but a bit shorter
* General FSpecial VFX/SFX improvements
